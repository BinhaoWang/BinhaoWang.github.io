I will be joining the College of Computing at the City University of Hong Kong as a Ph.D. student in Spring 2026. I am thrilled to continue my research under the supervision of Prof. Xiangyu Zhao, with whom I also had the privilege of working during my M.Sc. studies at CityU. My research focuses on the intersection of recommender systems, knowledge graphs, and large language models. I completed my undergraduate studies at Xiamen University.
