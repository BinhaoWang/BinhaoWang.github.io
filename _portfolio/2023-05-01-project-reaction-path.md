title: "Knowledge Graph-based Chemical Reaction Path Finding (Undergraduate Thesis)"
collection: portfolio
---
This project was my undergraduate thesis. I designed and implemented a data pipeline using the GPT API to perform automated semantic entity extraction from over 1,000 scientific papers, constructing a structured knowledge graph for reaction path analysis. This system improved search efficiency by 20% over traditional keyword-based baselines.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Django, GPT API, MongoDB, NetworkX.
