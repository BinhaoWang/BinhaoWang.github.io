title: "Application of HSIC for Non-linear Dependency Analysis (Independent Research)"
collection: portfolio

In this independent research, I applied the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to assess the goodness-of-fit for complex time-series models. I demonstrated its capability to capture complex, non-linear dependencies in model residuals where traditional linear methods like Pearson correlation fail.
